# High-temporal resolution characterization of surface ocean microbial communities via multi-omics

The mechanisms microorganisms employ to regulate their responses to environmental stress influence their biological and physiological diversity, their modes of adaptation to environmental change, and their impacts on ecosystem processes. However, datasets rarely integrate analyses that simultaneously characterize genomic potential alongside the transcriptomic and post-transcriptomic activities of natural microbial communities. Here, we present a multi-omic dataset comprising surface ocean metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, and metaepitranscriptomes collected every 90 minutes for 48 hours at two stations located in the coastal and the adjacent offshore tropical Pacific. Complementary biogeochemical measures increase the utility of the â€˜omic data in identifying the activities of surface ocean microbiomes and their responses to environmental variability. We expect that this integrated dataset of multiple sequence types and environmental parameters will facilitate novel insights into microbial ecology, physiology, and ocean biogeochemistry and will reveal mechanisms of adaptation on the genomic, transcriptomic, and translational levels.
